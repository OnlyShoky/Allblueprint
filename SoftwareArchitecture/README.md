## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### For Learning
If you are new to software architecture, we recommend exploring the folders in the following order:
1. **Principles:** Master the basics of clean code.
2. **DesignPatterns:** Learn standard solutions to common problems.
3. **BestPractices:** Understand how to build robust and maintainable systems.
4. **ModernArchitectures:** Explore how large-scale systems are built today.
5. **DataAndAI:** Dive into the world of data and machine learning.
6. **Cybersecurity:** Ensure your systems are secure.
7. **TrendsAndInnovations:** Stay ahead of the curve.

### For Reference
Each file is designed to be concise and self-contained. You can quickly look up a specific concept (e.g., "Factory Pattern" or "OAuth2") to get a clear explanation, code examples, and pros/cons.
