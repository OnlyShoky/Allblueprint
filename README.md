![Allblueprint Hero](assets/hero.png)

> [!note] Welcome to Allblueprint
> Allblueprint is a comprehensive knowledge repository designed to be the "Allblue" for software engineers, architects, and data professionals. Just as the legendary Allblue connects all seas, this project connects the vast domains of **Software Architecture**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Engineering**, and **Cybersecurity** into a single, harmonious ecosystem.

Whether you are a fullstack developer looking to master system design, a data scientist exploring MLOps, or an architect seeking the latest patterns, Allblueprint provides the structured knowledge you need to build scalable, secure, and intelligent systems.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### In Obsidian

> [!important] Optimized for Obsidian
> This knowledge base is fully optimized for Obsidian with internal links, backlinks, callouts, and graph view integration.

**Navigation Tips:**
1. **Start with [[index|the main index]]** for curated learning pathways
2. **Use Graph View** (`Ctrl/Cmd + G`) to visualize concept relationships
3. **Follow internal links** to explore connected topics
4. **Check backlinks panel** (right sidebar) to discover related notes
5. **Quick Switcher** (`Ctrl/Cmd + O`) for instant navigation to any topic

### For Learning

> [!tip] Recommended Learning Path
> If you are new to architecture, begin with the **Principles** folder to understand the "why" behind code structure.

1. **Start with the Basics:** [[SoftwareArchitecture/Principles/SOLID|SOLID]], [[SoftwareArchitecture/Principles/DRY_KISS_YAGNI|DRY/KISS/YAGNI]] to understand the "why" behind code structure.
2. **Explore Patterns:** Move to [[SoftwareArchitecture/DesignPatterns/|Design Patterns]] to see standard solutions to common problems.
3. **Scale Up:** Study [[SoftwareArchitecture/ModernArchitectures/|Modern Architectures]] and [[SoftwareArchitecture/BestPractices/|Best Practices]] to learn how to build production-ready systems.
4. **Specialize:** Dive into [[SoftwareArchitecture/DataAndAI/|Data & AI]] or [[SoftwareArchitecture/Cybersecurity/|Cybersecurity]] based on your interest or project needs.

### For Reference

Each Markdown file is self-contained. You can quickly look up a concept (e.g., "Circuit Breaker" or "RAG Pattern") to find:
- A clear explanation
- A code snippet (Python/JS)
- A diagram or flow description
- Pros and cons

### Visuals and Code
- **Diagrams:** We use ASCII and Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex flows.
- **Code:** Examples are provided in Python and JavaScript to be accessible to most developers.

## 🎨 Obsidian Graph View

> [!success] Visual Knowledge Network
> Use the Graph View to see how concepts interconnect. You'll notice clear clusters around major topics like SOLID principles, design patterns, architectural styles, and security concepts.

**Graph Navigation:**
- Zoom in/out to explore different detail levels
- Click nodes to jump to specific notes
- Watch for hub notes (nodes with many connections)
- Filter by tags to focus on specific domains
